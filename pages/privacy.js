        <br />
        <p>
          &quot;Personal Information&quot; is information that can personally
          identify you, such as your name, email address and telephone number.
          We maintain one or more databases to store your Personal Information
          and may retain it as reasonably required to serve you and operate the
          Site. Personal Information that we collect depends on how you use the
          Site. Providing your Personal Information to us is your choice.{' '}

        <p>
          {' '}
          When you visit the Site, we may automatically collect identifier and
          other technical information, such as your browser information,
          operating system information, device information, TCP-IP address and
          the date, time, length of stay and specific pages accessed during your
          visits to the Site (“Online Information”).

          If you register to use the Site, we may collect Personal Information
          including your name, email address, and telephone number and
          Residential address for delivery purpose.
          <br /> <br />
          You may review, update, or modify your account information, including
          profile and contact information, at any time by logging into your

        <p className='font-bold'>Online Identification Tools</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Like many website providers, we use your IP address to help diagnose
          problems with our server and provide a better web experience. Your IP
          address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and gather
          Online Information. <br />
          <br />
          We use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart. A cookie is a
          small file stored by your internet browser on your computer. <br />
          <br />A &quot;session cookie&quot; stores temporary information that
          is erased when you close your web browser or turn off your computer. A
          &quot;persistent cookie&quot; enables the Site to recognize you when
          you return to it and remains stored on your computer until you delete
          it. Your web browser is usually set up to initially accept cookies. If
          you set your browser to reject cookies, the Site will not be able to
          recognize your account. We do not and cannot use cookies to gather
          other information that may be stored on your hard drive.

          Tejdhar may use Google Analytics to monitor activity on the Site and

        <p className='font-bold'>How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and
          Chrome) incorporate a &quot;Do Not Track&quot; (&quot;DNT&quot;) or
          similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to
          have his or her online activity and behaviour tracked. If a website
          that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the
          browser can block that website from collecting certain information
          about the browser's user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT
          signals are not yet uniform.{' '}

        <br />
        <p className='font-bold'>Third Party Features</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Site also may include an activity feed, social media buttons and
          widgets, such as the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button or the
          &quot;Share This&quot; button. These features are either hosted by a
          third party or hosted directly on the Site and your interactions with
          them are governed by the privacy policy of the third party that
          provides the feature.

        <br />
        <p className='font-bold'>Use of Site via Mobile Device</p>

          If you use the Site through your mobile device, we may collect your
          geo-location information to assist us in fulfilling your order. We
          will not share this information with third parties and will only use
          this information for the sole purpose of fulfilling your order. You
          may at any time prevent the Site from using your location by turning
          this option off at the device level.

          websites before providing any information to or through them.

        <p className='font-bold'>Information Security</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We have instituted reasonable safeguards to help ensure that
          information collected is secure. We also take reasonable steps to
          ensure that third parties who work with us to make the Site (including
          the software, applications and Sites provided on the Site) available
          to you agree to protect personal information that they must access in
          order to serve you. <br />
          <br />
          When you send or otherwise transmit your sensitive information (such
          as your credit card number) to or though the Sites, your sensitive
          information is encrypted and protected with SSL, the current
          industry-standard encryption protocol. When you are on an
          SSL-protected page, a picture of a closed lock appears at the bottom
          or top of some web browsers. Another way to tell if you are on a
          secure page is to check the URL or address of the page. (Look in the
          address box or right-click on the page and select
          &quot;Properties&quot;.) These secure SSL-encrypted pages have URLs
          that start with &quot;https://&quot; instead of &quot;http://&quot;.{' '}
          <br />
          <br />
          Please understand, however, that it is possible for third parties to
          access information despite our efforts. Without limiting the terms of
          our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you understand that we do
          not guarantee that your use of the Site and/or information provided by
          you will be private or secure and we are not responsible or liable to
          you for any lack of privacy or security you may experience. You are
          fully responsible for taking precautions and providing security
          measures best suited for your situation and intended use of the Site.
          You also understand that any information provided by you or collected
          by us or our agents in connection with your use of the Site will be
          used in the manner described in our Terms of Use. Please do not use
          the Site if you do not agree to the terms and conditions described in
          this Information Security section. <br />
          <br />
          If you have any questions about security of the Site, please contact
          us.

        <p className='font-bold'>Changes to our Privacy Policy</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in
          our practices. When we post modifications to this Privacy Policy, we
          will revise the &quot;Last Updated&quot; date at the top of this web
          page. The modified Privacy Policy will be effective immediately upon
          posting on the Site. Your continued use of the Site after the posting
          of the modified Privacy Policy constitutes your agreement to abide and
          be bound by it. We encourage you to periodically review this page for
          the latest information on our privacy practices. If you object to any
          modification, your sole recourse is to stop using the Site.
